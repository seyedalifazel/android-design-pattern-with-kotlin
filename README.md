# Design Pattern in Android!

These are the results of my research for Android programming design patterns with Kotlin Language. There are some points for distinguishing between a expert Android code and a basic Android code, like:
- the code structure
- the comments used
- the variable names
- and something else

# Benefits of Design Pattern

I have mentioned the benefits of using Design Pattern in Android in the following:
- it can make your code clean by decoupling the code
- it makes your code clear and understandable
- it makes your code reusable and it prevents from repetition the code

# Getting Started
I have divided the design patterns into three categories, each containing the following patterns:
 1. Creational Pattern
-	Builder
-	Dependency Injection
-	Singleton

 2. Structural Pattern
-	Adapter
-	Facade

 3. Behavioural Pattern
-   Command
-   Observer
-   Model View Controller
-   Model View ViewModel
-   Clean Architecture

## *Creational Pattern*
Briefly, when we need a complex object, we do not copy and paste the same code every time we need an instance of this object or we need not create a new object each time.
